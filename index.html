            <p><strong>Hello there!</strong> I am junior at the University of Washington pursuing a degree in Informatics with a concentration in either <em>Data Science</em> or <em>Human-Computer Interaction.</em> 
               I taught myself how to code HTML and CSS when I was only nine years old, and have since recreationally created several webpages. I never thought that my interest in coding would go beyond web design; 
               however in college, I decided to take a Computer Science course for fun.
            </p>
            <p> I quickly realized that I have a talent for development and went from taking business prerequisites to Informatics prerequisites. 
               I was admitted into the competitive <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/academics/informatics" target="_blank">Informatics</a> and <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/bs" target="_blank">HCDE</a> programs this past summer, and am now a Teaching 
               Assistant within the iSchool and a Web Development intern at <a href="http://www.hercampus.com/" target="_blank">Her Campus</a>.

                    On top of taking rigorous coding classes at UW, I taught computer science classes to elementary through high school students.<br><br>
                    <strong>Languages:</strong> Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python

                  <h3>Leadership</h3>
                  I am a self-motivated leader. In high school, I founded a service club that worked to alleviate local poverty and grew it to over sixty members.<br><br>
                  I believe that, as a leader, it is most crucial to foster mutual respect within a team and facilitate transparent discussions.

                  <h3>Professionalism</h3>
                  I previously helped managed over thirty employees at <a href="http://www.computingkids.com/" target="_blank">Computing Kids</a> and was required to frequently communicate with both internal and external parties. The organization consistently recognized that I excel at maintaining a professional presence and am a strong communicator.

                  I believe that my ability to work well in teams originates from my love of team sports. I play volleyball, basketball, and online multiplayer games.<br><br>
                  I enjoy workplaces with a "work hard, play hard" attitude.
